My approach to design is simple. As a foundation, I believe in [Dieter
Ramsâ€™](https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design) principles of good
design. Good design is innovative, makes a product useful, is aesthetic,
is understandable. Good design is unobtrusive, honest, long-lasting, and
thorough. Most importantly - good design is as little design as
possible. 

And in an age where software developers are the new kingmakers, and the
human experience is a culture of application interfaces, the employment
of these principles requires a new mindset. Today, good design requires
an understanding of digital beyond just that of a mere specification,
but rather digital as an integral layer of the design process and user
experience from start to finish. And herein lies my advantage. 

I work differently than most designers in the space. My processes
incorporate an iterative style in user experience, research, design,
prototyping and development. I insist on being involved through the
entire lifecycle of a project and expect the same from applicable team
members.
