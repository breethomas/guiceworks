A simple user experience and clean\ninterface design for both the amHealth and Gozee MVP products was crucial for\nthe company’s initial product success in Africa. The UX needed to be easy to use\nas most of the healthcare facilities still use paper files. The UI design needed\nto enhance the UX, not stand in the way. We continue to work with Access Mobile,\niterating on their products based on feedback and market trends, offering more\nrobust features to improve healthcare in Africa. \n\n## Brand Design\n![Access Mobile Brand 01](/static/images/AM_Brand_01.png)\n![Access Mobile Brand 02](/static/images/AM_Brand_02.png)\n![Access Mobile Brand 03](/static/images/AM_Brand_03.png)\n\n\n## Interface Design\n![Access Mobile Gozee iso](/static/images/AM-GOZEE_iso.jpg)\n![Access Mobile Gozee UI 01](/static/images/AM-GOZEE_UI_01.jpg)\n![Access Mobile iso](/static/images/AM_iso.jpg)\n![Access Mobile UI 02](/static/images/AM_UI_02.jpg)\n![Access Mobile UI 01](/static/images/AM_UI_01.jpg)\n","id":"access-mobile"},{"title":"Cirrus MD","icon":"cirrusmd.svg","image":"/static/images/CMD_home.jpg","greybox":"/static/images/CMD_grey-box.jpg","next":"forelinx","prev":"moon","body":"\n# Telemedicine done right.\n\nCirrusMD is a mobile healthcare communication application that allows patients\n24hr access to doctors via text message and video chat.
