We include you in the process 100%, but are not afraid\nto tell you when you are wrong. The result - the right aesthetic that is an\nhonest and true statement about who you are.\n\n## Brand Boards\n\nGuiceworks defines Brand via a set of style boards, which showcase options in\nfont, color palettes, photography, iconography and preliminary UI elements.\nGuiceworks presents several brand directions, each comprised of multiple boards\nworking together to communicate one potential look and feel for the Brand. From\nthere, Guiceworks works closely with client to narrow in on one final set of\nstyles to serve as the basis for the Brand and UI design. This approach\neliminates any surprises in UI design as all members are effectively working\nfrom the same “style guide”. This phase can be run simultaneously with the UX\nphase to maximize timelines if required.\n\n","id":"brand-design"},{"title":"Experience Design","icon":"experience-design.svg","body":"\n# Experience Design\n\nText...\n\n","id":"experience-design"},{"title":"Front-end Engineering","icon":"front-end.svg","body":"\n# How it works.\n\nThese design systems ultimately need to be translated into working code that\nruns across various devices. This is a critical phase in the process where too\noften the design language, UX and branding get lost in the complexity of\ndevelopment. At Guiceworks, we help narrow the gap between design and\ndevelopment to ensure the implementation reflects the established brand and\nvisual language.\n\n\n\n## Deliverables\n\nWe can provide highly-composable, responsive UI components and front-end\ntemplates for integration with existing or new desktop and mobile applications.\nWe'll work with your team to ensure proper translation of the visual systems put\nin place through the design process and help them deliver pixel perfect\nimplementations across devices. We also provide front-end team augmentation\nalong with full working prototypes and initial builds for MVP releases.\n","id":"front-end-engineering"},{"title":"Graphic Design","icon":"graphic-design.svg","body":"\n# How you look.\n\nLess is more. We treat graphic design with a mindset that focuses on the least\namount of design to communicate effectively with the user. Inherent in this\napproach is a simple but stunning beauty for everything from the product to the\nbrand to all the minute interactions in between.\n\n","id":"graphic-design"},{"title":"Interface Design","icon":"interface-design.svg","body":"\n# How you interact.\n\nThis is ultimately where you make or break the experience for a user and the\nbusiness. Great UI Design is a seamless manifestation of Brand, UX and Graphic\nDesign. At Guiceworks, we are well versed in the development process and work\none-on-one with developers to correctly translate even the smallest design\ndetails to a fluid user interface. Working from the approved style boards, UI\ndesign is where we bring the work together under one intelligent and\nbeautiful execution. \n\n## Prototype\n\nDuring UI design, we're still prototyping. We build up layers on the \nprototype step by step, and when UI design is added to the mix, you have a solid \nproof of concept. Whether you use this to win over investors, seamlessly communicate\nbetween design and dev partners, or test a realistic experience with users -- this level\nof prototype delivers confidence in the path forward for building the right product.\n","id":"interface-design"},{"title":"Product Design","icon":"product-design.svg","body":"\n# Product Design\n\nProduct design copy\n","id":"product-design"}]}
