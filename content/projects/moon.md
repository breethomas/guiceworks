The Moon is mobile app designed for Life Coaches and their clients. The Moon engaged with Guiceworks to create the Brand and design the User Experience and User Interface for their start up product. This project offered the unique challenge that a coach could also be a client of another coach, combining two different types of user accounts into one. We started with the branding phase while we worked through the user and features flows. After creating a wireframe prototype we tested and validated functionality with existing coaches and potential clients before taking the approved brand and designing the User Interface to enhance the product experience.
