# Launch your life.

The Moon is mobile app designed for Life Coaches and their clients. The Moon
engaged with us to create the Brand and design the User Experience and User
Interface for their start up product. This project offered the unique challenge
that a coach could also be a client of another coach, combining two different
types of user accounts into one. We started with the branding phase while we
worked through the user and features flows. After creating a wireframe prototype
we tested and validated functionality with existing coaches and potential
clients before taking the approved brand and designing the Uer Interface to
enhance the product experience.
