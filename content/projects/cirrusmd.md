# Telemedicine done right.

CirrusMD is a mobile healthcare communication application that allows patients
24hr access to doctors via text message and video chat.  From initial brand
design, strategy and concept of the product, user experience and user interface
design we created the MVP product for CirrusMD back in 2012. After industry
research, testing and iterating on the product, we created a new version of the
UX and UI design based on industry response and user feedback. They have since
grown and created an internal team and continue to refine their product and
integrate with other healthcare systems.
