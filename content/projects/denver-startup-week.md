# Celebrating the entrepreneurial spirit.

Denver Startup Week engaged us to rebrand the event and extend that new brand
into a stronger, more cohesive online and offline presence overall. An icon and
color language that worked together with the DSW brand was created to define
tracks, events and subject matter. The website was rebuilt from scratch to
create a simplified, contextual overall experience for the user, both prior to
and during the event.
