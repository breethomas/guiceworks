# Celebrating the entrepreneurial spirit.

Denver Startup Week engaged Guiceworks to rebrand the event and extend that new
brand into a stronger, more cohesive online and offline presence overall. An
icon and color language that worked together with the DSW brand was created to
define tracks, events and subject matter. The website was rebuilt from scratch
to create a simplified, contextual overall experience for the user, both prior
to and during the event.
