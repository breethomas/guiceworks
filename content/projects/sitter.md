# Rediscover me time.

_Challenge:_ Assure parents “me” time is a good idea and offer an app they can trust to facilitate that time through a network of friends sharing sitters.

_Outcome:_ A marketplace of parents and sitters, where reviews, recommendations, payment, time tracking, and immediate contact with a caregiver is only a click away on their phone.
