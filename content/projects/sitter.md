# Rediscover me time.

User experience and user interface design for Sitter, an app that allows users
to find, book and manage babysitters. By relying on trusted friends and friends
trusted sitters, the app lets users “add” sitters to their account. Users can
then book and track appointments as well as pay sitters through the app. We
created a brand that communicates trust and resonates with parents, letting them
know its still ok to go out and enjoy “me” time. The app experience was designed
with this in mind. Simple and easy to use, while allowing a parent to track
their away time and always be a click away from communication with the sitter.
Lastly, the app allows parents to pay directly through Sitter, eliminating those
annoying trips to the ATM machine on the way home.
