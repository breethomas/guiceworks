# Simplify practice management and improve patient engagement.

Access Mobile creates products in the Health-tech industry for use in Africa. 
We've partnered with them from the start, defining their corporate brand and
sub brands for the individual products. A simple user experience and clean
interface design for both the amHealth and Gozee MVP products was crucial for
the companyâ€™s initial product success in Africa. The UX needed to be easy to use
as most of the healthcare facilities still use paper files. The UI design needed
to enhance the UX, not stand in the way. We continue to work with Access Mobile,
iterating on their products based on feedback and market trends, offering more
robust features to improve healthcare in Africa.
