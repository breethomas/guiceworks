# How you interact.

This is ultimately where you make or break the experience for a user and the
business. Great UI Design is a seamless manifestation of Brand, UX and Graphic
Design. At Guiceworks, we are well versed in the development process and work
one-on-one with developers to correctly translate even the smallest design
details to a fluid user interface. Working from the approved style boards, UI
design is where we bring the work together under one intelligent and
beautiful execution. 

## Prototype

During UI design, we're still prototyping. We build up layers on the 
prototype step by step, and when UI design is added to the mix, you have a solid 
proof of concept. Whether you use this to win over investors, seamlessly communicate
between design and dev partners, or test a realistic experience with users -- this level
of prototype delivers confidence in the path forward for building the right product.
